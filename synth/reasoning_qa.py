"""Reasoning route: extract the author's reasoning chain, verbatim.

The second content-bound generator. It reads the materialized excerpt corpus
(synth/output/excerpts.jsonl from `harvest`) and keeps the ones the affordance gate
tagged `argument` — passages that make a case, derive a result, or reason from
premises. These are passages that CONTAIN reasoning (the author does the reasoning),
not passages that can merely be reasoned about — so the answer is *extracted*, not
generated: the same anachronism guarantee as knowledge-QA, and no reliance on the
model to compose vintage-sounding logic.

  - the ANSWER is the author's reasoning chain, copied VERBATIM. Prefer one long
    contiguous span; but because a chain is naturally spread across a passage, the
    model MAY splice several verbatim spans (up to MAX_SPANS) into one coherent
    chain. Splicing is anachronism-safe: every span is verified as a literal
    substring and spans join with an ellipsis, so the model may only select and
    order — never write a connecting word. Capped, and told to prefer the fewest,
    longest spans, so it can't cherry-pick a disjointed chain.
  - the QUESTION stands alone (no passage attached — a visible passage would make
    extraction a degenerate echo), self-situating, "why does .../ how does it
    follow ...". Answer-first: find the chain, then write the question for it.

You are given a short passage from a pre-1930s book that argues a point, derives a
result, or reasons from premises. The author's own reasoning is in the text. Do two
things.

1. EXTRACT THE REASONING CHAIN, VERBATIM. Find where the author reasons from
   premises to a conclusion, and copy that chain WORD FOR WORD.
   - Return it as "spans": exact quotations from the passage that, read in order,
     form one coherent chain of reasoning (premises through conclusion). Prefer ONE
     long contiguous span. Use several only because the steps are spread out — never
     more than {MAX_SPANS}, and always the fewest, longest spans that hold the chain
     together.
   - Copy WORD FOR WORD. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, rewrite, correct, modernize,
     reorder within a span, or add any word not in the passage — including
     connecting words between spans. You may only select and order the author's own
     sentences.
   - Do NOT choose spans that refer to a figure, plate, diagram, table, page,
     section, or note number ("Fig. 36", "as shown in the figure", "see page 466",
     "§ 4", "the note on p. 22") — these point to something the reader cannot see and
     are meaningless on their own. Since you select and order the spans, pick ones
     that carry the reasoning WITHOUT such references; skip a sentence that leans on
     one. If the chain cannot be formed without them, omit this item.

2. Classify the passage's ACTUAL subject (what it is about, not the kind of book it
   came from) into exactly one of these classes, copied verbatim:

# CALL 2 — write the question, given the passage and the extracted chain (ANSWER).
# Isolated so the framing rules can be tuned without touching extraction.
QUESTION_SYSTEM = """\
You are given a passage from a pre-1930s book and a REASONING CHAIN quoted verbatim
from it — this is the ANSWER. Write the single question that this reasoning chain
answers.

- The chain must CORRECTLY AND COMPLETELY answer your question — ask exactly what
  this reasoning concludes or explains. Do not ask for a step, result, or identity
  the chain does not reach. Read the chain as the answer: if it does not fully
  answer, adjust the question to fit the chain.
- Pose a problem that must be reasoned through, not a fact to recall: "Why does
  ...", "How does it follow that ...", "Why must ...?".
- Write it in pre-1930s English: period vocabulary, spelling, and phrasing. Use no
  word, term, or idiom that came into use after 1930, and no modern conversational
  or academic phrasing — it must read as a question a period examiner would pose.
- The question must STAND ALONE and betray no awareness of a source. Never refer to
  the passage or to whoever wrote it — no "the passage", "the text", "the author",
  "the writer", "the speaker", "the narrator", "the argument", "according to", "as
  described", "as mentioned". Ask about the SUBJECT ITSELF, as a matter of fact in
  the world, to someone who never saw the passage. (Not "Why does the author hold
  that finite beings are on probation?" but "Why must finite beings be on
  probation?")
- SUPPLY THE CONTEXT THE READER NEEDS so the chain's "they / it / this / these" have
  clear antecedents:
    · for a matter of general record (a thinker, doctrine, war, ruler, work,
      statute, scripture), name it from your own knowledge;
    · for particular persons, places, or events described only in the passage,
      introduce them briefly in the question — who they are and the situation.
  Give just enough to make the question unambiguous — do not restate the whole
  scene, and never leave a bare "these beings", "such creatures", or "this process".
- Every proper noun must be one the reader can place: either widely recognizable on
  its own, or introduced with a short descriptor of who or what it is (not a bare
  "Skobeleff" but "the Russian general Skobeleff"). When in doubt, describe by role
  instead of naming.
- Do NOT reveal the answer: do not state the conclusion, and do not reuse the
  chain's distinctive wording. Ask for the reasoning; make the reader supply it.
