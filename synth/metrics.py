"""Model-free metrics for synthetic-question quality.

Each metric compares the synthetic questions against the authentic ones from the
SAME matched pairs, so authentic is the built-in target — a synthetic number is
"good" when it lands near its authentic counterpart, not near zero.

  echo         — fraction of a question's content words that also appear in the
                 answer. High echo = the question is a re-arrangement of the
                 answer (lexical inversion), which teaches word-shuffling, not
                 recall. Length-normalized loss cannot see this.
  fidelity     — how close the synthetic question is to the AUTHENTIC question for
                 the same answer, word-for-word. jaccard = shared content words /
                 union (bag); run = longest shared run of consecutive words as a
                 fraction of the synthetic question. Low fidelity = the generator
                 wrote a genuinely different question, not a paraphrase of the real
                 one. (This is a single number per pair — there is no authentic
                 baseline to compare against; the authentic question IS the target.)
  template     — share of questions opening "What is/are". Catechism openers are
                 varied (Why, How, Of what, Have, Can...); a high share means the
                 generator collapsed onto one frame.
  len_ratio    — mean question length in chars. Terse synthetic questions strip
                 down to the answer's key terms; the gap tracks over-compression
                 that echo alone misses.
