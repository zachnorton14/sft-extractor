"""Sample the pretrain corpus (jbduran/think-dataset) to feel out excerpt sourcing.

We source from the *uncleaned* think-dataset rather than the -clean-1930s variant
because only the uncleaned repo ships per-document metadata (`audit_metadata.jsonl`)
aligned row-for-row with the parquet. The clean repo is text-only and re-sharded
through a shuffle, so its rows can't be joined back to a category. Anachronism
filtering is therefore ours to do downstream, at excerpt granularity.

Each parquet row is a whole document (a book; median ~80k words), single `text`
column. Metadata for document at (shard S, row r) is audit record
`offset(S) + r`, where offset(S) is the cumulative doc count of shards < S taken
from manifest.json. Key metadata fields:

  topic_or_subject_gen        LoC class, classifier-placed (the subject axis)
  topic_or_subject_score_gen  classifier confidence -- low = suspect label
  resolved_year, title_src, author_src, word_count

Reads remote parquet with DuckDB over HTTP range requests (no bulk download);
caches manifest.json + audit_metadata.jsonl under .cache/ (127 MB, one-time).

    python -m synth.corpus --docs 12 --excerpt-words 60,120,240
