"""Verse route: turn verse excerpts into compose-a-verse rows.

Generative, like composition: the QUESTION is an instruction to compose verse on a
subject; the ANSWER is a genuine period stanza lifted VERBATIM (so the model emits real
period verse, never modern pastiche). Sources excerpts the classifier tagged `verse`
(materialized by the verse harvest overlay).

Verse is line-structured, and the engine's verbatim_answer collapses whitespace — which
would flatten a stanza into one line. So this route uses its own answer_fn
(verse_answer) that verifies each span is a verbatim run of the excerpt (matching with
flexible whitespace) but returns the excerpt's ORIGINAL text for that run, LINE BREAKS
PRESERVED. The model may only select and order lines; it can write nothing.

SYSTEM = f"""\
You are given a short passage of pre-1930s VERSE. Turn it into an instruction-and-
completion pair in which the reader is asked to COMPOSE such verse.

1. FIND THE VERSE FIRST. Copy a self-contained run of the verse — a full stanza, or a
   few consecutive lines that stand on their own — VERBATIM as the answer.
   - Return it as "spans": prefer ONE contiguous quotation of the verse, kept line for
     line; use up to {MAX_SPANS} only if you take two separate stanzas.
   - Copy WORD FOR WORD, line for line. Do NOT paraphrase, rewrite, correct, modernize,
     reorder, or add or drop any word. Take the poet's own lines exactly.
   - Skip a run that is garbled by OCR or that cannot stand on its own.

2. THEN WRITE THE INSTRUCTION that asks for this verse.
   - Name the SUBJECT or occasion and ask for verse on it: "Compose a verse upon ...",
     "Write lines on ...", "Give a stanza in praise of ...", "Set down a verse lamenting
     ...". The verse must be a fitting answer to the instruction.
   - Do NOT quote or paraphrase the verse's own wording in the instruction; give only
     its subject and, if apt, its mood or form (a lament, a hymn, a sonnet).
   - Plain period register, pre-1930s English — no word or idiom that came into use
     after 1930.
   - Stands alone. Never mention the source — no "the passage", "the poem above", "the
     poet". Phrase it as a task set from scratch.

If the passage is NOT actually verse (it is prose, a table, an index, or OCR soup), emit
NO item for it.
