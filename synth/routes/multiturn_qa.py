"""Multiturn route: turn one fact-rich excerpt into an interrelated Q&A conversation.

Genuine two-party period dialogue (catechism/deposition text) is too scarce to build a
multi-turn route on; instead this route is a HYBRID that rides on the huge `knowledge`
pool to synthesize multi-turn exchanges:

  - each USER turn is a model-COMPOSED question (period-schoolbook register), like
    knowledge_qa's question — anachronism on the question side is handled by the
    separate question filter, not here;
  - each ASSISTANT turn is a VERBATIM answer, one or two exact spans lifted straight
    from the excerpt and verified as literal substrings (verbatim_answer). No
    model-written word ever enters an answer, so the answers stay anachronism-safe by
    construction.

The point is MULTI-TURN, not dialogue provenance: the model picks several different
facts from one passage and threads them into an interrelated exchange. Only the FIRST
question must stand on its own (knowledge_qa's self-situating rule); follow-ups are
ALLOWED to lean on the context already established in the conversation ("And what
became of it?", "Why was that so?") — that coreference across turns is exactly the
behavior we want to teach, and it is safe because the antecedent now lives in an
earlier turn.

LENGTH is controlled by us, not the model: each excerpt is assigned a target number of
exchanges by a seeded per-doc RNG (_target_exchanges — a balanced mix over 2..5), the
model is asked for that many, and build_turns truncates any overshoot. This route is
2-EXCHANGE-AND-UP ONLY; single pairs are supplied (and cherry-picked) by the
knowledge_qa reserve, so an excerpt that can't sustain two exchanges is dropped here.

SOURCING: this route draws the MULTITURN SLICE of the knowledge pool
(corpus.knowledge_partition), which overlaps knowledge_qa's single-turn reserve on a
deliberate band — those excerpts are double-passed as both a single pair and a
conversation ("same facts, different forms").

Because the shape is a `conversations` list (not a single question/answer), this route
carries its own run/write loop, reusing the engine's transport, batching, retry,
state, and thinking-off config.

SYSTEM = f"""\
You are given a short fact-rich passage from a pre-1930s book and a target number of
question-and-answer EXCHANGES for it (its "exchanges" field — one exchange is one user
question plus one assistant answer). Build a question-and-answer conversation of that
length, between a curious USER who asks and an ASSISTANT who answers. Work in this order.

1. Pick `exchanges` DIFFERENT facts the passage states — a definition, a cause, a
   number, a consequence, a name. Each fact becomes one assistant answer, so choose
   facts that lie in DISTINCT places in the passage. Use as many as `exchanges` asks
   for; only if the passage genuinely lacks that many distinct facts, use fewer (never
   pad with weak or repeated facts, and never fewer than one).

2. For EACH fact, write the assistant's answer as "spans": a list of ONE exact
   quotation from the passage (up to {MAX_SPANS} only if the fact genuinely lies in
   separate places).
   - Copy WORD FOR WORD. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, rewrite, correct, modernize, or
     add any word not in the passage. Take WHOLE sentences: begin and end each span at
     a sentence boundary and keep its terminal punctuation.
   - The ASSISTANT ONLY ANSWERS — it never asks a question and never ends on a question.

3. For EACH answer write the USER question ("q") it answers.
   - The span must CORRECTLY AND COMPLETELY answer the question. Do not demand a name,
     number, or identity the span does not supply. Do not reveal the answer, or its
     distinctive wording, in the question.
   - Plain period-schoolbook register, pre-1930s English: period vocabulary, spelling,
     and phrasing. Use no word, term, or idiom that came into use after 1930. Never
     mention the source — no "the passage", "the text", "according to", "mentioned", 
     "the author".
   - The FIRST question must SELF-SITUATE — it must make sense to someone who NEVER saw
     the passage. Name the actual subject: the war, battle, place, ruler, work, statute,
     or scripture involved, using your OWN knowledge of the subject when the passage
     assumes it (e.g. "the Revised Statutes of the United States", "at the Battle of
     Williamsburg", "in the Gospel of Luke"). Frame the reader — supply the era, place,
     subject, or situation that makes the span the natural, correct answer.
     FORBIDDEN in the first question — references that mean nothing on their own:
     catalog, specimen, or figure numbers ("specimen 167"); a bare "the statute", "the
     act", "the gun", "the assembly", "the expedition"; a bare "it", "this", "they",
     "these"; or "two specific verses" / "a certain scholar" without naming which. If
     the fact you picked cannot be made to stand alone (it hinges on an item known only
     from the passage), pick a DIFFERENT fact to open with — one that can.
   - Any LATER question (when `exchanges` > 1) builds on the conversation so far — it
     MAY and SHOULD use natural follow-up phrasing that refers back to what was ALREADY
     ESTABLISHED in an earlier turn ("And why did that happen?", "What became of him
     afterward?", "How was it accomplished?"). But a pronoun or "the ___" is allowed
     ONLY when its antecedent was actually named in a previous turn; never introduce a
     NEW bare reference the conversation has not yet identified. Keep the thread
     coherent: each question should follow from the last answer.

4. Return the exchange as "turns": an ordered list ALTERNATING user, assistant, user,
   assistant …, beginning with a user question and ending with an assistant answer —
   one user+assistant pair per exchange, so `exchanges` pairs (2 x `exchanges` turns),
   or fewer only if the passage lacked enough distinct facts. A user turn carries "q";
   an assistant turn carries "spans". If the passage states no clean fact at all, emit
   NO item for it.
