"""Mine period-authentic deflection phrasings from the excerpt corpus.

The unparseable route needs answers, but no period book answers "xakhavjba" -- so
unlike every graded route, its answers cannot be lifted whole from prose. Authoring
them outright would smuggle in modern register, which is what the whole filter chain
exists to prevent. The compromise: mine the *fragments* verbatim from the corpus and
author only the assembly.

A fragment is reusable only if it is context-free. "I don't know what you mean" is;
"I don't know what you mean by load factor" is not. We keep a clause only when what
follows it is a terminator rather than a complement.

Yield is low by design -- roughly 30-40 distinct clauses across the full corpus --
so the generator composes them combinatorially rather than using them as whole answers.
