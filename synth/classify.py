"""Model classifier pass: route every harvested excerpt semantically.

The regex affordance gate (corpus.affordance_label) is a cheap RECALL net — it finds
candidate excerpts but can't make the semantic cuts that matter (grounded vs fiction, a
genuine document vs prose that merely says "whereas", how-to vs description). This pass
reads the materialized corpus and has a model assign each excerpt one or more ROUTE
classes from the fixed taxonomy below, plus a `drop` for unusable spans.

It is the cheapest model pass in the pipeline: the output is a short label list, not
prose, so batches pack hard. It runs once over excerpts.jsonl (resumable), writes the
model labels back as `classes` (multi-label, best-fit first) and `primary` (the highest
claim under CLAIM_ORDER), and leaves the regex `affordance` field untouched so the two
can be compared. Routes migrate from `affordance` to `primary` afterwards.

`primary` follows the priority claim order: rare, specific classes (stem, how-to, verse,
dialogue) claim an excerpt before the elastic catch-alls (knowledge, composition), so a
scarce class is never strip-mined by a class that fits almost anything.

SYSTEM = f"""\
You classify a short passage from a pre-1930s book by what kind of question-answer task
it could source. Choose from these classes ONLY, copied verbatim:
{_LABEL_LIST}

Rules:
- Excerpts are MULTIPURPOSE — one passage often supports several tasks. List EVERY class
  that applies; there is no limit, best fit first.
- But the bar is CONVICTION, not possibility. Include a class only when you are
  absolutely convinced the passage would make a GENUINELY GOOD source for that task — not
  merely a passage the task could be forced onto. When in any doubt about a class, LEAVE
  IT OUT. A short, precise list of certain classes beats a long list of maybes.
- "composition" is a producible-FORM tag, not a catch-all — add it only for a genuine
  specimen of a nameable form (whole or part), never just because prose could be
  reworded. A rare, specific class (stem_reasoning, how_to, verse, conversational) must
  be tagged whenever it truly applies; never omit it in favour of a broader one.
- narrative splits by whether the events are real: "narrative_grounded" for a real
  episode, "narrative_fiction" for an invented one.
- PREFER "drop" over forcing a weak class. If no class is a genuinely good fit — garbage,
  or readable prose with nothing worth extracting — return ["drop"] alone (never combined
  with a class). On a broad pool a substantial share should drop; that is correct.
